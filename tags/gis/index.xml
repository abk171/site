      <description>Earth Engine tricks: Satellite imagery coverage over a region of interest In my work with Google Earth Engine, over the last few months, I like to believe that I have learnt a few tricks to interact with it. I recently received a query about finding the percentage coverage of satellite imagery over a region of interest. In this post, I would like share a robust approach towards this problem.

I will try and apply his article for a more specific use case of downloading satellite imagery for a large region of interest. This article requires an understanding of the limitations of earth engine, particularly ee.Image.getDownloadURL(), because it is aimed at providing a work-around. Today we discuss the first step towards big downloads, tiling the region of interest.</description>
