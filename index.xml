      <description>Leetcode 255: Implementing Stacks Using Queues Head on over here to try the problem for yourself.
The solution talks about using 2 queues, which frankly I don&amp;rsquo;t understand :&amp;rsquo;). I used a single queue to implement this problem.
Algorithm The goal is to implement a stack using the basic queue features provided such as push(), peek() and pop(). The easiest way to implement this is by inserting elements in reverse order.</description>

      <description>Leetcode 1769: Max Number of K-sum Pairs Head on over here to try the problem for yourself.
This is a varaition of the famous two-sum problem that we have all struggled with :)
Algorithm &amp;amp; Code The slower O(n) The goal is the count unique pairs of integers that sum up to given k. For this, we create a hashmap that stores unique values of the integers. Then we go over the keySet() and update the count according to the following rules:</description>

      <description>Leetcode 581: Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray Head on over here to try the problem for yourself.
I solved this problem using a two-pointer method.
Algorithm The goal is to find the points where the array becomes unsorted. We use two loops, one to find the end of the unsorted sub-array and another to find the start of the unsorted sub-array. start = end = -1 as a way to check if they were updated or not during the loops.</description>

      <description>Leetcode 905: Sort Array by Parity Head on over here to try the problem for yourself.
I attempted a two-pointer approach to try and solve it.
Algorithm The goal is to try to return the parity array in one pass. For this reason, I create a new array result[] and two pointers, evenPtr, pointing to the start of result[] and oddPtr, pointing to the end of result[]. Now I loop over the initial array.</description>

      <description>Leetcode 844: Backspace String Compare Head on over here to try the problem for yourself.
There are a few ways discussed in the solutions. I will try to explain the two-pointer method.
Algorithm The goal is to try to build the resultant string in one pass. For this reason, we will iterate over the string backwards. If we encounter #, we simply skip the first valid character that follows. Ofcourse, the caveats are considering more backspaces (#) than actual words, in which case we simply get an empty string.</description>

      <description>Hi! I am Abhigyan. I am a 3rd year computer engineering student at Qatar University. This blog is a record of anything and everything that engages my monkey-brain. I tend to take up a lot of side projects but never end up completing them. I hope to record my progress as a means to motivate me to finish them :).</description>
